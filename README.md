# RFM-Analysis
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions. RFM analysis focuses on 3 main aspects of customers' transactions: recency, frequency, and purchase amount. RFM filters customers into various groups for the purpose of better service. It helps managers to identify potential customers to do more profitable business and to run an effective promotional campaign for personalized service.
